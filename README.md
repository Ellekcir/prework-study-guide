## Description

Prework Study Guide Webpage - is a project that I have worked on to introduce myself to the basics of Coding Bootcamp. It has been a project for me to be able to work on making my first webpage. The webpage has been developed to help my understanding of features such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. This project allows the user to be able to explore some of the facts in relation to what I have learnt. It provides enough facts to get a basic understanding of the core topics in relation to starting in Web Development. I was able to take away beginner level knowledge of how to strusture, design and make a webpage functional. Some of the challenges were in relation to git and getting an idea of how it worked in correlation to local applications such as VS.
